# Luigi Langella Portfolio
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The website is designed for a band to promote
their music and includes images, video and audio samples as well as a form to book them for concerts and and to
follow their latest tour dates.


## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://luigilangella.github.io/Milestone-Project-one/).

## Wireframe
A basic mockup of the website before development [here] (New Mockup 1.png)


## UX
My goal in the design was to make a good looking website but at the same time functional so to give the user
a smooth overview of what the band has to offer. It is a one main page website with separate links to some external content. The user will be able to access all the important info on the home/index page but also see images and watch/listen to the band with the use of the latest tecnologies available.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
4. Fontawesome
5. Google Font
6. JS, jquery


## Features
This site uses jQuery's animate() method to add smooth page scroll. The navbar is fixed to the top to provide at medium and large screen size a full range of option to the user. On a small screen the website rezises to fit any screen and offers the same navbar functionality but in a burger icon style.


### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add further funcionality to the site to showcase all the tecnologies and programming languages i am learning. 


## Testing
 This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. Most of the styling and coding was done with the help of the Crome Developer Tools, then implemented in Visual Studio Code. All the files have been committed regulary to GitHub.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/luigilangella/Milestone-Project-one.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
